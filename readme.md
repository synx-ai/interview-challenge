# Synx Challenge
Welcome to the Synx interview challenge! This repository is designed for candidates to fork and create Pull Requests with their solutions.

### What to expect
We understand that everyone's time is valuable, all challenges are designed to be short and concise way to explore skills we are interested in, in that way, we also try to offer a complete guide in how to install the needed environments and data (if required) and an extensive guide in how to submit results, so can focus on your soulution.

In this challenge, we simplified the tools and processes that we actually use. It's ok not to be familiar with some of them, as the team we would like to be, we are here to help anyway we can, feel free to open an issue if you have any doubts.

### What we are looking for?

- **Data Science**: To undestand your own though process to solve problems, how do you use, process and present data. 

- **Technical Skills**: To assest your familiarity with tools and processes.
